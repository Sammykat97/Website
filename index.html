    Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Battling The Strongest Trainers

I will be going over some of the battle music and its impact on the players. 
More specifically, I will be writing about the music used during battles against the Elite Four and Champion in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. 
 First, I will give a short rundown of what occurs in most Pokémon games for those new to the series.

<br>
Like many of the Pokémon games, you start as a young Pokémon trainer who has just gotten their first Pokémon from the professor of the region. 
On your journey across the region, your main goal is to defeat the gym leaders and obtain their badge, which provides access to the Elite Four and the Champion. 
However, while on this journey, you uncover a secret organization that is trying to dismantle the world as you know it. 
Through countless battles, you make it to the elite four who possess the titles of the strongest trainers of the region, but one stands above them all, Cynthia. <br> </br>
<h2> The Elite Four </h2>

Battle Music for Elite Four:

</br>
 <h3>Cynthia: Champion of the Sinnoh League</h3>

<br>
Champion's Battle Music:
<br>
<br>
<audio controls>
    <source src="champion battle music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
</br>
<br>
The music helps emphasize the final challange that awaits the player. 
All the previous struggles that you faced strengthened you and your Pokémon friends. 
Only one trainer guards the way to the Hall of Fame. However, Cynthia is no pushover and will not prove to be an easy battle.

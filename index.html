On this site, I will go over the effect of battle music in Pokémon on players when dealing with difficult challenges. 
This will pertain to the evil organization, the Elite Four, and the Champion within this series.

At the beginning of this game, you get to choose between three different starters, which will play a vital role in your journey. From there, the game loop begins. You go town to town getting stronger, collecting new Pokémon, and collecting Gym Badges. The game has three objectives:
</center>
1. Collect all 8 gym badges so you can gain access to the Elite Four and beat the champion
<br>2. Take down team Galactic
<br>3. Complete the Pokedex(optional)
<center>
<h2> The Elite Four </h2>

Battle Music for Elite Four:

 <h3>Cynthia: Champion of the Sinnoh League</h3>

<br>
Champion's Battle Music:
<br>
<br>
<audio controls>
    <source src="champion battle music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
</br>
<br>
The music helps emphasize the final challange that awaits the player. 
All the previous struggles that you faced strengthened you and your Pokémon friends. 
Only one trainer guards the way to the Hall of Fame. However, Cynthia is no pushover and will not prove to be an easy battle.

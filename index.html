    Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Battling The Strongest Trainers
 </center>
 </h1>
<body>
On this site, I will go over how pleasure in play arises from battling strong trainers in Pokémon and how the battle music amplifies those feelings. 
This will pertain to the evil orgization, the Elite Four, and the Champion within Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.

<br></center> 
At the beginning of this game, you get to choose between three different starters, which will play a vital role in your journey. From there, the game loop begins. 
You go town to town getting stronger, collecting new Pokémon, and collecting Gym Badges.
Although this is the main goal of the game, there are usually at least three objeectives for completing the game.
<br>

<u>The three in this series are:</u>
<br>1. Collect all 8 gym badges so you can gain access to the Elite Four and beat the Champion
<br>2. Take down Team Galactic
<br>3. Complete the Pokedex (optional)


<h2><center> The Evil Team Galactic</center> </h2>
Ran by Cyrus and his three commanders, they plot to dismantle the current world and rebuild it. They want to create a world where there is no human spirit because they believe it is human emotions that ruin the world. Cyrus plans on trapping the legendary Pokémon to achieve his goal, so it falls on you to take them down.

<h4 style="font-size: 40px;">Losing = Fun?</h4></center>
Throughout your journey, you will come across different types of trainers who vary in team comps and strength. 
Sadly, you cannot always win, especially on your first try. However, the game does not hinder your growth, but losing is not without consequence. 
If you lose, you lose around 10% of your money, and in some cases, you lose friendship value with the Pokémon on your team. The game loop demonstrates Lindley's concepts of play and pleasure. 
The first, <b><u>"Play is a 'Vorubung und Einubung' of activities which soon are to be necessary to the serious life of the adult animal."</u></b>(1) 
The second, <b><u>"...pleasure in triumphing over obstacles, the joy in success, victory."</u></b>(1) 
This concept is important when thinking about the reasons behind why we put ourselves through the grind. 
We want to succeed and feel the joy of overcoming difficult challenges. 
While it is the loop that is invoking this emotion, the battle music enhances that feeling and helps drive you to success. 
It is the music that helps transport us into the world of our character.

<h5 style="font-size: 40px;"> Why Does This Matter To Me?</h5>
</center>
Mostly, this is a game from my childhood and feels nostalgic. I remember my young self playing for days, struggling and training my Pokémon so I could take on the stronger battles. 
It was fun building my team, collecting stronger/rarer Pokémon, and even bonding with them. 
Although this game might not have been real to others, it was real to me. 
The experiences and feelings I had while playing and bonding with my friends felt real to me. 
These connections and feelings correlate to Baudrillard and his work Simulacra and Simulation. 
He states, <b><u>"The imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false, it is a
deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate the fiction of the real in the opposite camp."</u>S</b> (2) 
This idea of both reality and simulation being equal makes the existence of those experiences and feelings feel more real than the reality I am living in. 
The bonds I created and trials I overcame were not mere simulations but an extension of my reality.

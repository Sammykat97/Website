In this game, like many of the Pokémon games, you play as a young trainer who is given a rare Pokémon from the professor of the region in the hopes of becoming the strongest trainer of the region. As a 10yr old you uncover and thwart an evil organization that is trying to use the legendary Pokémon in hopes of creating a new world where there is no human emotions or spirit.

I will be going over the music battle music and its impact on the players. First, I will give a short rundown of what occurs in most Pokémon games for those new to the series. More specifically, I will be writing about the music used during battles against the Elite Four and Champion in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.
Like many of the Pokémon games, you start as a young Pokémon trainer who has just gotten their first Pokémon from the professor of the region. On your journey across the region, your main goal is to defeat the gym leaders and obtain their badge, which provides access to the Elite Four and the Champion. However, while on this journey, you uncover a secret organization that is trying to dismantle the world as you know it. Through countless battles, you make it to the elite four who possess the titles of the strongest trainers of the region, but one stands above them all, Cynthia.

All the previous struggles that you faced strengthened you and your Pokémon friends. Only one trainer guards the way to the Hall of Fame. However, Cynthia is no pushover and will not prove to be an easy battle.

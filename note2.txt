Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Battling the Strong

DESCRIBE THE GAMEPLAY AND WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THE GAME AND THE NARRATIVE ARC

On this site, I will go over the effect of battle music in Pokémon on players when dealing with difficult challenges. 

At the beginning of this game, you get to choose between three different starters, which will play a vital role in your journey. From there, the game loop begins. You go town to town getting stronger, collecting new Pokémon, and collecting Gym Badges. The game has three objectives:
1. Collect all 8 gym badges so you can gain access to the Elite Four and beat the champion
2. Take down team Galactic
3. Complete the Pokedex(optional)

Battle Music

Ran by Cyrus and his three commanders, they plot to dismantle the current world and rebuild it. They want to create a world where there is no human spirit because they believe it is human emotions that ruin the world. Cyrus plans on trapping the legendary Pokémon to achieve his goal, so it falls on you to take them down.

The game loop demonstrates Lindley's concepts of play and pleasure. The first, "Play is a 'Vorubung und Einubung' of activities which soon are to be necessary to the serious life of the adult animal." The second, "...pleasure in triumphing over obstacles, the joy in success, victory." This concept is important when thinking about the reasons behind why we put ourselves through the grind. The music adds to this feeling of conquering the battle. 

The music adds an extra layer of enjoyment but also intensifies the experience of the battle. It makes you feel more worried because when the music changes, it's for a reason. Both the music and battling a strong opponent amplify the feeling of joy when you win.
